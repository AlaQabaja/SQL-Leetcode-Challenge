-- Question 111
-- Table: Activity

-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | player_id    | int     |
-- | device_id    | int     |
-- | event_date   | date    |
-- | games_played | int     |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- (player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
-- This table shows the activity of players of some game.
-- Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

-- We define the install date of a player to be the first login day of that player.

-- We also define day 1 retention of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

-- Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Activity table:
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
-- | player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
-- | 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
-- | 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
-- | 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
-- | 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
-- | 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

-- Result table:
-- +------------+----------+----------------+
-- | install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
-- +------------+----------+----------------+
-- | 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
-- | 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
-- +------------+----------+----------------+
-- Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the
-- day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
-- Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00

-- Solution
with t1 as(
select *,
row_number() over(partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk,
min(event_date) over(partition by player_id) as install_dt,
lead(event_date,1) over(partition by player_id order by event_date) as nxt
from Activity)

select distinct install_dt,
count(distinct player_id) as installs,
round(sum(case when nxt=event_date+1 then 1 else 0 end)/count(distinct player_id),2) as Day1_retention
from t1
where rnk = 1
group by 1
order by 1


-- My solution
Our record of interest is the install date record for each player and the record
that follows it in terms of date. 
1) Partitioned by player, we rank by event_date --> install_date will have rank of 1
2) event_date in this case will equate to install_date 
3) We partition by player, we find the lead date value --> next date value 
4) We filter records to only show where rank = 1
5) We group by install_date from above and we calculate:
sum records where next_date = event_date + 1 and divide by count for that date

WITH rank_table AS 
(
SELECT player_id,
       event_date, 
	   row_number() over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as date_rank,
	   lead(event_date,1) over(parition by player_id order by event_date) as next_date
FROM Activity
)
SELECT event_date as install_date, 
       count(distinct player_id) AS installs_on_that_date, 
	   SUM(CASE WHEN next_date = event_date + 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/count(DISTINCT player_id) AS Day1_retention
FROM rank_table 
WHERE date_rank = 1
GROUP BY event_date
